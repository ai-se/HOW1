abstract = {Adoption of advanced automated SE (ASE) tools would be favored if a business case could be made that these tools are more valuable than alternate methods. In theory, software prediction models can be used to make that case. In practice, this is complicated by the "local tuning" problem. Normally, predictors for software effort and defects and threat use local data to tune their predictions. Such local tuning data is often unavailable. This paper shows that assessing the relative merits of different SE methods need not require precise local tunings. STAR1 is a simulated annealer plus a Bayesian post-processor that explores the space of possible local tunings within software prediction models. STAR1 ranks project decisions by their effects on effort and defects and threats. In experiments with two NASA systems, STAR1 found that ASE tools were necessary to minimize effort/ defect/ threats.},

queries can be conducted over the uncertain parameter ranges. Such
queries can generate an overwhelming amount of data. We describe a
general method for understanding that data. Large-scale what-if queries
can guide Monte Carlo simulations of a model. Machine learning can then
be used to summarize the output. The summarization is an ensemble of
decision trees. The TARZAN system [so-called because it swings through
(or searches) the decision trees] can poll the ensemble looking for
majority conclusions regarding what factors change the classifications
of the data. TARZAN can succinctly present the results from very large
what-if queries. For example, in one of the studies presented, we can
view the significant features from 10<sup>9</sup> what-if queries on
half a page},

Classification and Regression Trees reflects these two sides, covering the use of trees as a data analysis method, and in a more mathematical framework, proving some of their fundamental properties.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

abstract = {Derived from the concept of self-adaptation in evolution strategies, the CMA (Covariance Matrix Adaptation) adapts the covariance matrix of a multi-variate normal search distribution. The CMA was originally designed to perform well with small populations. In this review, the argument starts out with large population sizes, reflecting recent extensions of the CMA algorithm. Commonalities and differences to continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are analyzed. The aspects of reliability of the estimation, overall step size control, and independence from the coordinate system (invariance) become particularly important in small populations sizes. Consequently, performing the adaptation task with small populations is more intricate.},
